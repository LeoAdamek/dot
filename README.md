dotfiles
========

My *personsal* collection of 'dot-files' used to configure various programs.

Now with an install script to automatically set up the configurations.

Documentation provided primarily for my own reference.

Usage
-----

1. Clone the repo somewhere personal and unobrtusive like `$HOME/.dotfiles`
2. Run the `install.sh` script, it'll figure out what to do.
